## About the Dashboard

I developed this dashboard as a personal learning tool to better understand end-use energy consumption patterns and to compare energy use across different countries.

## Features

- **Total Energy Consumption by Country**  
  Visualize and compare total energy consumption across multiple countries. You can select one or more countries from the list for individual analysis or cross-country comparison.

- **Sector-wise Energy Consumption**  
  Choose from four key sectors: **Industrial**, **Residential**, **Service**, and **Transport**. Analyze energy consumption within a selected sector for the chosen country and year.

- **Year-on-Year Growth**  
  Track the **year-on-year growth** in energy consumption for the selected sector and country to identify trends over time.

- **Energy Share in Total Consumption**  
  View the **share of sectoral energy consumption** in the total energy use of the selected country for a given year.

This dashboard provides an interactive and intuitive way to explore global energy consumption data by end-use category and geography.
